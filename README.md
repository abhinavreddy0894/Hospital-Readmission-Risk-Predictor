# Hospital-Readmission-Risk-Predictor
A machine learning system that predicts 30-day hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients using the UCI Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset. The tool provides:
- Individual patient risk scores
- Key risk factor identification
- Evidence-based intervention recommendations

## Dataset
Uses the [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) containing:
- 100,000+ diabetic patient encounters
- 50+ features including demographics, lab results, medications
- 30-day readmission status (target variable)
